    :width: 100

- Added models for hate-speech detection and classification
- A large part of DaCy is now moved to seperate packages to allow for more versatility:

  - Now uses `spacy-wrap <https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/spacy-wrap>`__ for including existing models in DaCy.
  - Removed augmenters, they are now available through the external package `augmenty <https://kennethenevoldsen.github.io/augmenty/>`__
  - Removed the rule-based sentiment pipeline instead we recommend using `asent <https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/asent>`__

- Removed support for multiple installs, thus :code:`pip install dacy[all]` or :code:`dacy[large]` is no longer required. This should simplify installation processes and avoid errors
- Documentation

  - New `tutorial <https://centre-for-humanities-computing.github.io/DaCy/using_dacy.sentiment.html>`__ on using the sentiment models, including emotions detection, subjectivity detection and polarity classifcation.
  - New `tutorial <https://centre-for-humanities-computing.github.io/DaCy/using_dacy.hate_speech.html>`__ on using the hate speech classification and detection.
  - Multiple updated on function and package documentation

- Multiple bugfixes

**1.2.0 (04/11/21)**

- Removed DaNLP dependency, now DaNLP models is downloaded directly from Huggingface's model hub which is faster and more stable 🌟.
- Removed the readability module, we instead recommend you use the more extensive `textdescriptives <https://github.com/hlasse/TextDescriptives>`__ package developed by [HLasse](https://github.com/HLasse) and I for extracting readability and other text metrics.
- Added support for the configuring the default the model location with the environmental variable 'DACY_CACHE_DIR' thanks to a PR by `dhpullack <https://github.com/dhpollack>`__ 🙏.


**1.1.0 (23/07/21)**

- DaCy in now available on the `Huggingface model hub <https://huggingface.co/models?search=dacy>`__ 🤗 . Including detailed performance descriptions of biases and robustness.
- It also got a brand new online `demo <https://huggingface.co/chcaa/da_dacy_medium_trf?text=DaCy+er+en+pipeline+til+anvendelse+af+dansk+sprogteknologi+lavet+af+K.+Enevoldsen%2C+L.+Hansen+og+K.+Nielbo+fra+Center+for+Humanities+Computing>`__ - try it out!
- And more, including documentation update and prettier prints.

**1.0.0 (09/07/21)**

-  DaCy version 1.0.0 releases as the first version to pypi! 📦
    * Including a series of augmenters with a few specifically designed for Danish
