# Using DaCy

DaCy includes a series of tutorials on how to get started using DaCy as well how to use
DaCy for sentiment analysis and Hate speech Analysis and more. If you are unfamiliar with
DaCy/spaCy we recommend starting with the first guide.


These tutorials include state-of-the-art models _trained as a part of_ DaCy:

```{eval-rst}
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   tutorials/basic
```

And tutorials on how to use state-of-the-art models trained by others but _wrapped and accecible_ in DaCy:

```{eval-rst}
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   tutorials/sentiment
   tutorials/hate-speech
