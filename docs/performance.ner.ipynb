This dataset is annotated across many different domains including fiction, web content, social media, wikis, news, legal and conversational data. The original dataset includes annotations corresponding to the ontonotes standard (see [getting started](https://centre-for-humanities-computing.github.io/DaCy/tutorials/basic.html#fine-grained-ner) for the full list). To test the generalization we here convert the annotations to the CoNLL-2003 format using the labels `Person`, `Location`, `Organization`. As CoNLL-2003, `Location` includes cities, roads, mountains, abstract places, specific buildings, and meeting points. Thus the `GPE` (geo-political entity) were converted to `Location`. The `MISC` category in CoNLL-2003 is a diverse category meant to denote all names not in other categories (encapsulating both e.g. events and adjectives such as ”2004 World Cup” and ”Italian”), and is therefore not included."

This page represents only parts of the paper. We recommend reading the paper for a more thorough and nuanced overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "The augmentation we will be using in this test are performed on the DaNE test set and include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spelling Error**: Intended to similar domains with inconsistent spelling, OCR errors, conversational data, etc.. The augmentation includes a series of smaller augmentation:\n",
    "  - Keystroke error: The augmentation is used to introduce errors by replacing a character with a character that is close on the keyboard.\n",
    "  - Character swap: The augmentation is used to introduce errors by swapping two neighboring characters.\n",
    "  - Token swap: The augmentation is used to introduce errors by swapping two neighboring tokens.\n",
    "- **Synonym Augmentation**: This augmentation is used to simulate the variation and slight grammatical errors in the language and uses two different methods:\n",
    "  - Wordnet Synonym replacement: The augmentation replaces a token with a synonym in WordNet while respecting its syntactic role.\n",
    "  - Embedding Synonym replacement: This augmentation replaces a token with a synonym which tends to appear in similar contexts.\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Spacing**: This augmentation is used to simulate inconsistent spacing in the language and uses two different methods by either randomly adding or removing spaces.\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Casing**: This augmentation is used to simulate inconsistent casing in the language and uses two different methods by either randomly capitalizing or lowercasing tokens.\n",
    "- **Historical Spelling**: This augmentation is used to simulate historical spelling in Danish including ASCII spellings of the letters Æ (Ae), Ø (Oe), and Å (Aa) as well as uppercasing nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of the augmentations the probability of an augmentation is set to 2% and the number of augmentations is set to 1. The augmentations are performed using the [augmenty](https://kennethenevoldsen.github.io/augmenty/index.html).\n",

    "The underlying assumption of making these augmentations is that the tags of the tokens do not change with augmentation. In our case, this includes that \"Anna Østergaard\" is still a person and that \"vonde\" can still be considered a verb based on its context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, we can assume that if a model performs worse on a certain set of names or with minor spelling variations or errors, we can conclude that the model is vulnerable to such input. For instance, if the model has a hard time when replacing æ, ø, and å with ae, oe, and aa, it might not be ideal to apply to historic texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the example above, while text with 5% keystroke is still readable. However, 15% keystroke errors tests the limit of what humans and models can reasonably be expected to comprehend.\n",

    "- Even simple replacements of æ, ø, and å with ae, oe, and aa lead to notable performance degradation.\n",
    "- In general, larger models handle augmentations better than small models with DaCy large performing the best.\n",
