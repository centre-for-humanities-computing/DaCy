Acknowledgements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DaCy is a result of great open-source software and contributors. It wouldn't have been
possible without the work by the SpaCy team which developed and integrated the software.
Huggingface for developing Transformers and making model sharing convenient. Multiple
parties including Certainly.io and Malte Hojmark-Bertelsen for making their models
publicly available. Alexandra Institute for developing and maintaining DaNLP which has
made it easy to get access to Danish resources and even supplied some of the tagged data
themselves.
