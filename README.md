<!-- start short-description -->
DaCy is a Danish natural language preprocessing framework made with SpaCy. Its largest pipeline has achieved State-of-the-Art performance on Named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing for Danish. Feel free to try out the [demo](https://huggingface.co/chcaa/da_dacy_medium_trf?text=DaCy+er+en+pipeline+til+anvendelse+af+dansk+sprogteknologi+lavet+af+K.+Enevoldsen%2C+L.+Hansen+og+K.+Nielbo+fra+Center+for+Humanities+Computing.). This repository contains material for using DaCy, reproducing the results and guides on usage of the package. Furthermore, it also contains behavioural tests for biases and robustness of Danish NLP pipelines.

## üîß Installation

You can install `dacy` via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```bash
pip install dacy
```

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage
To use the model you first have to download either the small, medium, or large model. To see a list of all available models:

```python
import dacy
for model in dacy.models():
    print(model)
# ...
# da_dacy_small_trf-0.2.0
# da_dacy_medium_trf-0.2.0
# da_dacy_large_trf-0.2.0
```

To download and load a model simply execute:
```python
nlp = dacy.load("da_dacy_medium_trf-0.2.0")
# or equivalently (always loads the latest version)
nlp = dacy.load("medium")
```

To see more examples, see the [documentation].
